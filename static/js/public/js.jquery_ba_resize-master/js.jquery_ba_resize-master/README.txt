Introduction
============

This library packages `jquery.ba-resize`_ for `fanstatic`_.

.. _`fanstatic`: http://fanstatic.org
.. _`jquery.ba-resize`: http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-resize-plugin/

This requires integration between your web framework and ``fanstatic``,
and making sure that the original resources (shipped in the ``resources``
directory in ``js.jquery_ba_resize``) are published to some URL.
